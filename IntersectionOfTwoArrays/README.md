## Goal
Practice finding the intersection of two integer arrays, i.e., identifying elements that are present in both arrays.

## Concepts Used
- Arrays
- Nested loops
- Conditional statements
- Basic input validation
- User input with Scanner
- Element comparison

## Purpose
Educational practice for learning how to compare arrays and detect common elements in Java. This project reinforces the understanding of loops, nested loops, and conditional logic for solving basic array problems.
