# 📦 Array Exercises (Java)

This folder contains a collection of **Java array exercises**, starting from basic concepts and gradually moving toward more **algorithmic and problem‑solving oriented challenges**.  
The goal of this section is to build a **strong foundation in arrays**, loops, and logical thinking.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered
- One‑dimensional arrays
- Iteration using loops
- Conditional logic
- In‑place array manipulation
- Basic algorithmic techniques (two pointers, frequency counting)
- Problem solving with arrays
