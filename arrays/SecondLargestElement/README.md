## Goal
Find the largest and seconde largest elements in an integer array using an optimal single-pass algorithm without sorting the array or using additional data structures.

## Concepts Used
- Arrays
- Loops (enhanced for loop)
- Conditional statements
- User input with Scanner
- Variable tracking
- Integer.MIN_VALUE constant
- One-pass algorithm (O(n) time complexity)
- Comparison logic

## Purpose
Educational practice for understanding efficient array traversal, maintaining multiple state variables during iteration, and implementing an optimal algorithm to solve the "second largest element" problem in Java without sorting.
