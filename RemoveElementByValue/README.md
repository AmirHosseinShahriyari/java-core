# Remove Element by Value (Java)

## 📌 Description
This project is a simple Java console application that **removes a specific value from an integer array**.

The user enters the array size and elements, then specifies a target value.  
All occurrences of the target value are removed, and the remaining elements are stored in a **new array**.

This project demonstrates how to handle array manipulation in Java where array size is fixed.
