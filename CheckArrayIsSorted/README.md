# Check Array is Sorted

## Goal
Practice checking if an integer array is sorted, either in ascending or descending order.

## Concepts Used
- Arrays
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Basic input validation
- User input with Scanner
- Boolean flags for logic control

## Purpose
Educational practice for learning clean and basic Java programming. This project demonstrates how to determine if an array is sorted without using advanced libraries or data structures, reinforcing fundamental skills in array manipulation and algorithmic thinking.
