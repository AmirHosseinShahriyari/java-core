# Count Even and Odd Numbers (Java)

## 📌 Description
This project is a simple Java console application that **checks each element of an integer array and determines whether it is even or odd**.

The user specifies the array length, enters the values, and the program prints each number with its corresponding type (even or odd).

This project is part of the **Arrays practice series** for learning Java fundamentals and conditional logic.
