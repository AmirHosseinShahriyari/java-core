## Goal
Practice removing all duplicate elements from an integer array without using an extra array. The program outputs only unique elements from the array.

## Concepts Used
- Arrays
- Nested loops
- Conditional statements
- Boolean flags
- Basic input validation
- User input with Scanner

## Purpose
Educational practice for learning how to work with arrays and detect duplicates in Java. This project demonstrates an in-place approach to identify and exclude repeated elements, reinforcing fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditions, and logical thinking without relying on additional data structures.
