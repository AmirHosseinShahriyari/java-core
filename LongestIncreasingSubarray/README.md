## Goal
Practice finding the longest increasing subarray in an integer array, where elements are continuous and strictly increasing.

## Concepts Used
- Arrays
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Basic input validation
- User input with Scanner
- Index tracking

## Purpose
Educational practice for learning how to analyze arrays, detect increasing sequences, and track subarray boundaries in Java. This project reinforces the understanding of loop-based traversal, comparison of adjacent elements, and managing indices for subarray extraction.
