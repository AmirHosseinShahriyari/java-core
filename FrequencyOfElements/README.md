## Goal
Practice finding the frequency of each element in an integer array and counting how many times each number appears.

## Concepts Used
- Arrays
- Nested loops
- Conditional statements
- Basic input validation
- User input with Scanner
- Counting technique
- Duplicate detection logic

## Purpose
Educational practice for understanding how to work with arrays and nested loops in Java. This project demonstrates how to count the frequency of elements without using advanced data structures like HashMap, helping improve algorithmic thinking and core programming skills.
